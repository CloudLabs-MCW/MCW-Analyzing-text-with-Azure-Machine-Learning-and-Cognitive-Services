# Cognitive services and deep learning hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement a solution that combines both pre-built artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of various Cognitive Services with custom AI in the form of services built and deployed with Azure Machine Learning service. In the lab, you work with unstructured text and image data and learning how to develop analytics pipelines for various problems such as text summarization, text classification, image detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and sentiment analysis. You learn how to build and train a deep neural net for text classification. You also learn how to deploy multiple kinds of predictive services using Azure Machine Learning and learn to integrate with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API from Cognitive Services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to present solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning service, Azure Machine Learning compute instance, and Cognitive Services.

## Overview

In this workshop, you help Contoso Ltd. build a proof of concept that shows how they can develop a solution that amplifies their agents' claims processing capabilities.

## Solution architecture

The high-level architecture of the solution is illustrated in the diagram. The lab is performed within the context of a notebook running within Azure Machine Learning compute instance. Various notebooks are built to test the integration with the Cognitive Services listed, train custom ML services, and integrate the results in a simple user interface that shows the effect of processing the claim with all of the AI services involved.

![The High-level architectural solution begins with submitting a Claim for processing using a notebook in Azure Databricks. This notebook coordinates the calls to Computer Vision, Text Analytics, and Containerized Services, including a Classification Service and a Summary Service that both processes claim text.](media/high-level-architecture.png "High-level architectural solution")

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.
    - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

## Exercise 1: Locate the Lab Notebooks

Duration: 5 minutes

In this exercise, you will navigate to the folder where all the notebooks for this lab are available.

### Task 1: Open the notebooks folder

1. From within Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the `Compute` section by selecting it from the left-hand navigation menu.

    ![The Compute tab is highlighted in the left-hand menu within Azure Machine Learning studio.](media/ml-workspace-compute.png "Machine Learning studio Compute tab")

2. Select the **Jupyter** link associated with your compute instance, **csdl-compute-SUFFIX** to open the Jupyter Notebooks interface.

   ![The Jupyter link is highlighted next to the csdl-compute-SUFFIX compute instance.](media/ml-workspace-compute-instances.png "Compute instances")

3. Navigate to the `> mcw-csdl > MCW-Cognitive-services-and-deep-learning > Hands-on lab > notebooks` folder where you will find all your lab notebooks.

    ![Jupyter notebook interface showing the folder where the lab files are present.](media/jupyter-hands-on-lab-notebooks.png "Jupyter Notebooks Folder")

## Exercise 2: Create and Deploy an Unsupervised Model

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you create and deploy a web service that uses a pre-trained model to summarize long text paragraphs.

### Task 1: Install libraries

The notebooks you use throughout this hands-on lab depend on specific Python libraries like Keras and TensorFlow. The following steps walk you through adding these dependencies.

1. Within the `notebooks` folder on the Jupyter interface, select the notebook named `00 init.ipynb`. This link opens the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

    ![The 00 init.ipynb notebook is highlighted within the notebooks folder on the Jupyter page.](media/jupyter-notebooks-00-init.png "00 init.ipynb")

2. Run each cell in the notebook to install the required libraries.

### Task 2: Read through and execute the Summarization notebook

1. Within the `notebooks` folder on the Jupyter interface, select the notebook named `01 Summarize.ipynb`. This link opens the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

    ![The 01 Summarize.ipynb notebook is highlighted within the notebooks folder on the Jupyter page.](media/jupyter-notebooks-01-summarize.png "01 Summarize.ipynb")

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

    > **Note**: Make sure you copy the scoring URI from the output of the last cell of this notebook. The scoring URI value is needed in the final notebook of this hands-on lab.

### Task 3: Provision the Azure Machine Learning Workspace and Create the Summarization service

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, provide the necessary values indicated in the instructions, and execute the cells as instructed.

## Exercise 3: Create and Deploy a Keras Model

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you use Keras to construct and train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) called the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. LSTM works well for text classification problems, especially when used in conjunction with word embedding such as GloVe for word vectorization. In this notebook, you also learn how GloVe word embeddings perform on word analogy tasks.

### Task 1: Create a simple Keras based model

1. Within the `notebooks` folder on the Jupyter interface, select the notebook named `03 Claim Classification.ipynb`. This link opens the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

    ![The 03 Claim Classification.ipynb notebook is highlighted within the notebooks folder on the Jupyter page.](media/jupyter-notebooks-03-claim-classification.png "03 Claim Classification.ipynb")

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

   > **Note**: Pay attention to the top of the notebook and check the TensorFlow and Keras library versions. The TensorFlow version should be 2.0.0, and the Keras version should be 2.3.1.

### Task 2: Deploy the Keras model

1. Within the `notebooks` folder on the Jupyter interface, select the notebook named `04 Deploy Classifier Web Service.ipynb`. This link opens the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

    ![The 04 Deploy Classifier Web Service.ipynb notebook is highlighted within the notebooks folder on the Jupyter page.](media/jupyter-notebooks-04-deploy-classifier-web-service.png "04 Deploy Classifier Web Service.ipynb")

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

    > **Note**: Make sure you copy the scoring URI from the output of the last cell of this notebook. The scoring URI value is needed in the final notebook of this hands-on lab.

## Exercise 4: Completing the solution
