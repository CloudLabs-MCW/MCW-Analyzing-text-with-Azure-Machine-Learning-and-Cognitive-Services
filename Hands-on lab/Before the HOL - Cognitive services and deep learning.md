# Cognitive services and deep learning before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

   - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.
   - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 25 minutes

In this exercise, you set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided _before_ attending the Hands-on lab.

> **Important**: Many Azure resources require globally unique names. Throughout these steps, the word "SUFFIX" appears as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or other value to ensure uniquely named resources.

### Task 1: Create a resource group

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **+Add**.

   ![+Add is highlighted in the toolbar on Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Resource groups")

3. On the Create a resource group **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group**: Enter `hands-on-lab-SUFFIX` as the name of the new resource group, where SUFFIX is your Microsoft alias, initials, or other value to ensure uniquely named resources.
   - **Region**: Select the region you are using for this hands-on lab.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Create a resource group Basics tab.](media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create**.

5. On the **Review + create** tab, ensure the Validation passed message is displayed and then select **Create**.

### Task 2: Provision a Text Analytics API

In this task, you create a Text Analytics API, which will be integrated into your final POC.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the **Show portal menu** icon and then choose **+Create a resource** from the menu.

   ![The Show portal menu icon is highlighted, and the portal menu is displayed. Create a resource is highlighted in the portal menu.](media/create-a-resource.png "Create a resource")

2. Select **AI + Machine Learning** in the Azure Marketplace list and then select **Text Analytics** from the featured services list.

    ![In the New resource blade, AI + Machine Learning is selected under the Azure Marketplace and Text Analytics is highlighted under the featured services.](media/create-resource-text-analytics.png "Text Analytics")

   > Note: If you shown `Select additional features` page, select **Skip this step**.

3. On the **Create** tab, provide the following:

    Project details:

    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource group**: Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the dropdown list.

    Instance Details:

    - **Region**: Select the region you used for the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.
    - **Name:** Provide a unique name for this instance, such as ta-SUFFIX.
    - **Pricing tier**: Free F0 (5K Transactions per 30 days).
    - **Responsible AI Notice**: Checked

    ![The Create Text Analytics Basics tab is populated with the values specified above.](media/create-text-analytics.png "Create Text Analytics")

4. Select **Review + create**.

5. Ensure validation passes and then select **Create** on the Review + create tab.

### Task 3: Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace

In this task, you provision the Azure Machine Learning workspace you will use throughout this hands-on lab.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using the credentials for your Azure subscription.

2. In the upper-left corner of Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource**.

3. Use the search bar to find the **Machine Learning**.

4. Select **Machine Learning**.

5. In the **Machine Learning** pane, select **Create** to begin.

   ![The Machine Learning page displays with the Create button selected.](media/bhol-01.png 'Open Create Azure Machine Learning Workspace')

6. Provide the following information to configure your new workspace:

   - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription that you want to use.

   - **Resource group**: Use an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, we use **hands-on-lab**.

   - **Workspace name**: Enter a unique name that identifies your workspace. In this example, we use **ml-wksp**. Names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that's easy to recall and to differentiate from workspaces created by others.

   - **Location**: Select the location closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace.

   - **Container registry**: Use an existing container registry in your subscription or create a new container registry with `Standard SKU`.

   ![The Machine Learning Create form is displayed populated with the aforementioned values. The Review + Create button is highlighted.](media/bhol-02.png 'Create Azure Machine Learning Workspace page')

7. After you are finished configuring the workspace, select **Review + Create**. Select **Create** after you review the fields you just entered.

    > **Note**: It can take several minutes to create your workspace in the cloud.

    When the process is finished, a deployment success message appears.

8. To view the new workspace, select **Go to resource**.

9. Navigate to the [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://ml.azure.com) and select the workspace that you created or select **Launch now** under **Try the new Azure Machine Learning studio** in the **Overview** section of your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

   ![The Machine Learning resource page is shown with Overview selected from the left menu, and the Launch now button highlighted in the Overview screen.](media/bhol-03.png 'Launch the Azure Machine Learning studio')

### Task 4: Create a Compute Instance

In this task, you add a compute resource to your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

1. In the new Azure Machine Learning studio window, select **Create new** and then select **Compute instance** from the context menu.

   ![Within Azure Machine Learning studio, Create new is selected and highlighted, and Compute instance is highlighted in the context menu.](media/machine-learning-studio-create-new-compute-instance.png "Create new compute instance")

2. On the create compute instance screen, enter the following information:

   - **Compute name**: Enter csdl-compute-SUFFIX, where SUFFIX is your Microsoft alias, initials, or other value to ensure uniquely named resources.
   - **Virtual machine size**: Standard_DS3_v2

   ![On the create compute instance dialog, CPU is selected for the virtual machine type. Select from recommended options is selected under virtual machine size, and Standard_DS3_v2 is selected and highlighted in the recommended virtual machine sizes.](media/compute-instance-01.png "Create compute instance")

3. Select **Create** and wait for the Compute Instance to be ready. It takes approximately 3-5 minutes for the compute provisioning to complete.

### Task 5: Import the Lab Notebooks

In this task, you import Jupyter notebooks from GitHub that you will use to complete the exercises in this hands-on lab.

1. Select the Compute Instance, **csdl-compute-SUFFIX**, and then select **Jupyter** link to open Jupyter Notebooks interface.

   ![The Jupyter link is highlighted next to the csdl-compute-SUFFIX compute instance.](media/ml-workspace-compute-instances.png "Compute instances")

2. Check **Yes, I understand** and select **Continue** in the trusted code dialog.

   ![In the Always use trusted code dialog, Yes, I understand is checked, and the continue button is highlighted.](media/trusted-code-dialog.png "Always use trusted code")

3. In the new Jupyter window, select **New** and then select **Terminal** from the context menu.

   ![In the Jupyter notebooks interface, the New dropdown is selected, and Terminal is highlighted in the context menu.](media/jupyter-new-terminal.png "Open new terminal window")
  
4. Run the following commands in order in the terminal window:

   - `mkdir mcw-csdl`
   - `cd mcw-csdl`
   - `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Cognitive-services-and-deep-learning.git`

   ![In the Jupyter terminal window, the commands listed above are displayed.](media/jupyter-terminal.png "Import repository")

5. Wait for the `clone` command to finish importing the repo.

### Task 6: Setup Lab Environment

1. From the terminal window run the following commands (assuming you are in the `mcw-csdl` folder):

   - `cd "MCW-Cognitive-services-and-deep-learning/Hands-on lab/notebooks"`
   - `conda activate azureml_py38`
   - `pip install --upgrade pip`
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   ![In the Jupyter terminal window, the commands listed above are displayed.](media/jupyter-terminal-02.png "Setup Lab environment")

You should follow all these steps provided *before* attending the Hands-on lab.
